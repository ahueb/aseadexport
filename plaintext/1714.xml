Moy discusses her experiences as a professor at Sangamon State University in 1972.   She helped create the counseling department and develop the Child, Family, and Community Services program.  She reminisces about her fellow colleagues and the dedicated students who were able to complete their upper level studies at the newly created SSU.  Moy taught classes in marital difficulty and human sexuality, topics that were controversial at the time.
