    Scope and Contents
This collection contains part-time faculty personnel files kept by the Vice-Chancellor for Academic Affairs.  The majority of files contain only course evaluations.  A few, however, contain course plans, correspondence, newspaper clippings, and employment records. These files are of part-time faculty members who are no longer with the University.
