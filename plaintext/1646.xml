This series is limited to business of the Springfield Board of Education.  It includes Board planning for desegration; letters, petitions and oral arguments to the board; Legal briefs, motions and correspondence regarding desegregation. And minutes of Board meetings. (Some minutes are missing, possibly because of Prof. Jordan's absence.)  Nothing in this series is related to Prof. Jordan's position of Applied Studies Director, Sangamon State University.
