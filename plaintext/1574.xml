    Scope and Contents
Prior to 1980 all graduating students at SSU were required to submit Graduation Reports to their advisors 30 days before the end of their final term.  This applied both to undergraduate and graduate students.  The reports consisted of a self assessment and demonstration of the students' academic achievement and communication skills.  Teacher evaluations are also included in some reports.
