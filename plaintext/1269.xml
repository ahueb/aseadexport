    Scope and Contents
The Graduate Council records (1985- ) consists of the council's agendas, minutes, and working papers. These include changes in policies of SSU graduate programs as well as catalog changes.  Records also include memos to and from the council and the University Assembly and documentation of the inception of the Graduate and Undergraduate Councils.  The Faculty Senate Graduate Council, formed in 1984 as a standing subcommittee of the Curriculum and Academic Standards Committee, develops, reviews, evaluates, and facilitates policies concerning graduate standards and the development of present and proposed graduate curricula.
