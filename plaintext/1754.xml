Osborne was one of the first students to register at Sangamon State University in 1969 and graduate with a master's degree in business.  He recalls attending the "commuter campus" because there was no student housing and taking business classes with Professor Stanley Sokolik.  With his recent visit to campus, Osborne notes how different the campus is today from 40 years ago.
