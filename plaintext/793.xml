    Scope and Contents
A Springfield coalition of black community organizations founded in 1968 "to create a unity aimed at strengthening the bargaining position of the Black Community so as to solve its economic, political and social problems." Rudolph S. Shoultz, pastor of Union Baptist Church, and Charles Young were the primary organizers. 

By-laws, minutes, letters, financial records, and news clippings documenting the philosophy, structure, activities, goals, and concerns of the Black Action Movement; its independence from the Black Egyptians; and its views on militant action. Activities documented include investigations concerning fights and expulsions of black students at Southeast High School; protests against the Springfield Housing Authority's hiring and rental practices; sponsorship of a Little League baseball team; and use of the Spirit, a black newspaper, as its official voice.
