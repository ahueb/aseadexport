    Scope and Contents
This oral history focuses on the history of home birth advocate Catherine Feral and her memories of her life in Springfield, IL, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. McGregor, a long serving history professor at UIS sought to understand and preserve the story of Cat Feral's contributions to the Women's Health Movement. This story includes a description of her childbirth practice in Illinois and also notes the federal government charges of consumer fraud brought against Feral in 1982 that forced her to move to Oregon. The interviews took place at Feral's home in Oregon on October 23-24, 1998.The collection consists of interview tapes, a printed transciption, assignment of rights, a postcard from Oregon, and a 2010 Illinois Times about midwifery in Illinois.
