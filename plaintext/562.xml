    Scope and Contents
This series fully documents the formal business of the Assembly.  Under  Interim Governance (1970-74) the University Assembly generated policies and policy recommendations.  With  the adoption of the SSU Constitution in February 1975,  the Faculty, Staff, and Student Senates became responsible for  the generation of policies and policy recommendations.  The Assembly (consisting of the Faculty, Staff and Student Senates merging as a body) votes to approve or disapprove bills and resolutions passed  in the Senates.  The Faculty Senate generates far more bills and resolutions than do the Staff and Student Senates.
