    Scope and Contents
Harold A. Katz was elected Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives from Glencoe in 1964. He served for nine terms from 1965-1983 and was active in many areas. His special interests included civil liberties, public health and safety, criminal law, regional transportation, licensure legislation, "sunset" legislation, legislative rules and procedures, and the convention for a new state constitution. Perhaps, though, his greatest contribution to the legislature was facilitating the creation of the Commission on the Organization of the General Assembly (COOGA). This collection contains files that he assembled throughout his legislative career pertaining to all of the aforementioned areas of special interest.Series 1, Subject Files (Boxes 1-14, and 15, folders 1-9), contains subject files organized by topic and arranged mainly in alphabetical order that include such items as clippings, correspondence, memorandum, literature, and copies of house bills and amendments.Series 2, Political Career (Box 15, folders 10-19 and Box 16), contains files related to Katz's political life.Series 3, Reports, Speeches, Writings and Statements (Box 17, folders 1-5), includes writings and notes by Katz and "Reports from Springfield."Series 4, Correspondence (Box 17, folders 6-26, Box 18- 20 and 21, folders 1-13), contains letters received and written during his term in legislative office, organized in chronological as well as topical order.Series 5, Constituents (Box 21, folders 14-15 and Box 22, folders 1-2), contains correspondence, clippings, and notes.Series 6, Clippings, 1964-1982 (Box 22, folders 3-14), contains newspaper clippings about legislation.Series 7, Bills Signed into Law (Box 23, folders 1-18 and Box 24, folders 1-4), contains bills with which Katz was associated and passed into law. They are arranged by session, then by bill number and subject (74th G.A. Session to 82nd G.A. Session).Series 8, COOGA (Commission on the Organization of the General Assembly) (Box 24-25, and 26, folders 1-3), contains Katz's files related to this committee.Series 9, Books and Publications (Box 26, folders 4-6 and Box 27-28) includes law books, legislative publications, and copies of Katz's oral history.

    Processing Information
The paper records were placed in legal-size acid-free folders. These folders were normally labeled according to the titles of the original folders. The records were arranged in the original order in which they arrived. When a folder was obviously placed out of order, it was arranged in its proper sequence. The original order was able to be maintained and a proper sequence of nine series was created on account of a personal filing index provided by the creator. Some records were water damaged, and placed into acid-free archival envelopes, which were then placed in labeled acid-free folders. An abundance of newspaper clippings were included in this collection. Because of the acidity of newspaper, a majority of them were photocopied. These photocopies were stored in the folders while the originals were recycled. When there was too large of an amount to photocopy, they were placed in acid-free archival envelopes. These envelopes were then placed in labeled acid-free folders. The books and other publications in this collection were organized into a series and placed into boxes. Because these publications were not included in the personal filing index, they were assigned to the last series in the collection.
