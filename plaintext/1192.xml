    Scope and Contents
This film was planned as the audiovisual component of the Lincoln Sites Project.  Work was stopped after 15,000 ft  had been shot.  Some of the film is rough footage and some has preliminary editing.  Out-takes are included.  The theme is life in New Salem and Springfield in the days of Abraham Lincoln.
