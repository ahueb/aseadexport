    Scope and Contents
These records consist of official records (agendas and minutes), as well as working papers (correspondence, memos, reports, announcements and notes). These records also include information concerning various Staff Senate committees such as the elections committee and the food pantry committee. In conjunction to these documents, the Staff Senate Update, a monthly staff newsletter is included as well.They are perhaps the best single source of information about SSU/employee relations.
