    Scope and Contents
The Cooperative Complex, Inc. was jointly proposed by SSU, the Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce, and the State of Illinois. It was meant to be a research center for national, regional, state organizations and associations with a focus on governmental and public affairs research, but it never became a reality.
The 1982-1985 Cooperative Complex collection (later known as the Public Affairs Research Center) includes meeting agendas and minutes planning the creation of the center, Articles of Incorporation, by-laws, correspondence, expenditure reports, annual reports, and names and addresses of the Board of Directors and others involved in the planning, which include President Alex B. Lacy, Willard Bunn, Mary Fairchild, Senator John Davidson.  Also included are advertising strategies for Public Relations and Clayville along with proposed brochures for the center highlighting SSU and the Springfield area.
