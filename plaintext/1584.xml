    Scope and Contents
Howard Disson, Dean of SSU library, proposed a statewide academic library system to the IBHE (Illinois Board of Higher Education) in October 1972.  When proposal rejected,  he called a meeting of twelve directors of academic libraries in central Illinois in January 1973.  The Sangamon Valley Academic Library Consortium (SVALC) was established and directory published the same year.  The following objectives were established  by consensus at the March 1975 meeting:  to develop avenues for sharing resources;  to foster professional growth of member librarians;  to influence statewide planning for academic libraries.  This series consists of SVALC agendas and minutes, correspondence, and published directories.
