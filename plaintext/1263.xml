    Scope and Contents
Copies of various journals relating to Radical Therapy from 1971-1983.  The Radical Therapist journal was created in 1970 by the Radical Therapist Collective in Minot, North Dakota and went through many name changes over the next decade. It emerged in the context of the counter-culture and the radical U.S. antiwar movement. Radical therapy strives to use psychiatry as a force of liberation, suggesting that some methods of psychotherapy may be means of oppression in that their aim is to assist the individual in adjusting to the status quo when in fact it is the status quo that should change.Titles include The Radical Therapist, Rough Times, Journal of Radical Therapy, State &amp; Mind: People Look at Psychology, Issues in Radical Therapy, and Issues in Cooperation &amp; Power. Suzanne Brown contributed to some of these journals and collected these editions along with former Sangamon State University faculty members Ron Sakolsky and Bob Sipe.  In 2010 Brown contributed an oral history of her time as a student at Sangamon State University collected as part of the Alumni SAGE Society oral history project.SEE ALSO MC43 - Cooperative Power, Inc. records, which include further information regarding these Radical Therapy journals.
