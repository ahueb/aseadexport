    Scope and Contents
S1/02 - Proof  sheets are cataloged and shelved separately from positive prints.  Each sheet is given its accession number and is listed in the card catalog by subject and name(s).

Not to be confused with S1/01 - This (now defunct) records series contained positive prints arranged by accession number.  Each print was catalogued in the old card catalog with subject and name entries in the card catalog.  Positive photographs were numbered S1/1/[number] and negatives were numbered SN1/1[number] so they can be matched by number.  This file was merged into the photograph file at some point.  The folder resides in the defunct file.
