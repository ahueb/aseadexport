Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Hasara, former state legislator and Mayor of Springfield, was the second person to register for classes at the newly created Sangamon State University in 1970, working for a Psychology degree and a teaching certificate to obtain her goal of becoming a teacher.  Class credits were in quarters, grades were only pass/fail, classes were small (10-20), professors were cooperative, and the atmosphere was casual and easy going.  She attended a class on Women's Liberation and two of her professors were Judy Everson and Jackie Jackson.  Karen returned for a legal studies degree in the early 90s and saw many changes at SSU from the early days.
