    Scope and Contents
Audio broadcasts for PAC 407: Individual Freedom and the State taught by SSU Professor Peter Wenz as a radio Side-band radio course during summer 1981.  This course explored the tension between individual freedom and the state action, focusing on the paradox that the state often requires what individuals would not freely choose, yet the social order it secures appears to be the precondition of all freedom.  Based on the recorded lectures of the 1977 Intersession.
