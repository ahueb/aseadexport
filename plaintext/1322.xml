Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Dickerman, SSU Recruiter/Admissions staff member and former SSU student discusses her experiences at Sangamon State University, having graduated in 1986.  Barbara and Cullom Davis reminisce about the early days of the university, discussing faculty members, the few buildings on the campus, and the recruitment of students (including Vietnam veterans).  SSU was created with a commitment to community activism (including community organizing) working to create equal opportunity for all (first referred to as fair housing).  She remembers how women especially flocked to SSU to obtain a degree and learn about new ideas.
