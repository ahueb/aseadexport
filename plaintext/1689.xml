Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Lohman was a member of the Springfield Committee for Higher Education that started meeting in 1966 to start the new university in the capitol city.  The name – Sangamon State University – was selected from nominations by the public and was so named after the Sangamon River that flows through the area.  She discusses the uniqueness of SSU because it was a junior/senior level university, unlike any other higher education institution in the State of Illinois.
