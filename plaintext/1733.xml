Troop discusses her experiences at Sangamon State University as both a student and faculty member.  She graduated in 1972 with a master's in educational leadership and then taught in the applied study office for over 20 years before retiring in 2008.  She remembers the importance of the public affairs component required for graduates of SSU and her work with placement of students for both student teaching and applied study internships.
