Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Logan enrolled at Sangamon State University in 1970 at the downtown registration center set up in the Myers Building.  He wanted to go into public service and so wanted to attend the new public affairs school opening in Springfield. He was able to take CLEP courses that brought him up to junior level so he could begin his undergraduate degree in psychology. Logan worked for Governor Jim Edgar and several mayors of Springfield, including Telford, Ossie Langfelder and Karen Hasara.
