ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM

He then discusses his years in the General Assembly as a State Representative (1922-32) and as a State Senator (1932-53): political acquaintances, road and bridge legislation, campaigning and constituent service, legislative technique, legislative acquaintances, patronage and party, and conservation legislation. Also recalls the years after his retirement: return to private life, Pekin area political acquaintances, his daughter's family, and thoughts on current politics. 6 tapes, 345 mins., 128 pp., plus index
