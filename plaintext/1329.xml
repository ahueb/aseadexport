Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Chapin discusses attending Sangamon State University in the very beginning when grades were pass/fail or students awarded their own grades, when classes were held at the Leland Hotel in downtown Springfield, and how she took CLEP tests to earn a Master's degree in psychology without earning an undergrad degree or having taken any clinical psychology courses.
