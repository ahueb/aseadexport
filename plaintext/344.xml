    Scope and Contents
Accreditation by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools (NCA) entails periodic institutional self-study reports combined with reports of NCA-appointed visiting teams.  The process generated many memos and reports about the history, status of each academic/administrative unit of the university.  Boxes 1 and 2 provide a somewhat chronological detailed account of the process.  Box 3 contains data furnished to the NCA accreditation committee by administrators of SSU divisions, centers, clusters, and programs.
