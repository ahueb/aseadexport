Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Peck recently retired as Public Relations Director for the University of Illinois Springfield.  She attended the upper division only Sangamon State University as a nontraditional part time student to get a degree in English while she worked as a newspaper reporter in Decatur, IL.  She took classes with Judy Everson, Proshanta Nandi, and Rich Shereikis and later became a graduate assistant for Mike Lennon while continuing her education in English, earning a master's degree. The opportunity arose for her to work at SSU in the Public Relations department and enjoyed the "glorious ride," as Peck refers to her years of service at the university.
