These files contain notification of appointments and re-appointments: non-instructional assignment reports; professional activities reports; recommendations and decisions about retention, promotion, merit pay increase and tenure; appeals of decisions; documentation of public affairs activities; copies of published books and articles. These are the files on which Program, Cluster, and University Personnel Committees base their recommendations to conveners, deans, vice president for academic affairs and chancellor. These are files of either faculty, emeritus, resigned, or terminated.  Closed faculty personnel files are restricted for use only by the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and the Chancellor's Office.
