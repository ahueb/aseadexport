    Scope and Contents
The Center for the Study of Middle Size Cities, administratively located in the Organization and Management Cluster, was organized in 1973.  In 1986 it became the Center for Community &amp; Regional Studies, located in the School of Public Affairs and Administration.  In 1988 it became the Center for Enrepreneurship and Enterprise Development, located in the School of Business and Management.
Documents in this series predating 1988,  no matter how prevalent to CEED,  were generated by its predecessors or introduced from outside the center.  
These records include research instruments and data as well as final reports.  They also include minutes, meeting notes, memos &amp; correspondence.  Despite its title, CEED has both public agencies (i.e. IDOT) and not-for-profit organizations (i.e. Coalition for the Homeless) among its clients.
