Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Camp, former English professor at Sangamon State University, discusses his many years of service at the university.  He was hired by George Cohen as part of what was intended to be a diverse faculty at SSU when it first opened, taught classes at the downtown locations because the campus was not complete, and looked forward to teaching only junior and senior students at the new upper-level only university.
