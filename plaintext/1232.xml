    Scope and Contents
There is no retention program for student &amp;  faculty writing in the English Program, so these five papers may have been retained for particular interest or simply by accident.  Dennis Camp became an enthusiastic proponent of Vachel Lindsay's poetry only after coming to SSU as a faculty member in the Literature Dept.  The "Vachel Lindsay Newsletter," which he edited and  published during its brief existence documents his interest.
The Literature Program became the English program in the 1987-88 school year.
