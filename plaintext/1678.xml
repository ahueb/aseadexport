Martin remembers arriving at Sangamon State University in the early 1970s in a Volkswagen van.  She could see little bit of campus with no permanent buildings and a lot of cornfields.  Martin discusses her experience at Sangamon State as a "wife of" a faculty member and later when she became an educator with the Learning Center for students.
