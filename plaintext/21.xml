    Scope and Contents
The Illinois Central Blues Club was founded in 1986 by Vicki Biddle to promote public education and appreciation of Blues music as a cultural art form, to sponsor live Blues performances, to publicize the significant cultural contributions of Blues musicians, songwriters, and performers, and to promote and participate in Blues festivals in central Illinois.  

The ICBC collection contains organizational documents such as Articles of Incorporation, lists of founding members, board members, and other members; meeting minutes and agendas, and treasurer's reports.  Also included are club newsletters from 1986-1994, schedules and calendars of events, mass mailings, notes and plans for programs such as "Blues in the School," harmonica workshops, and a four-part video series of blues musicians and music at the Lincoln library.  Brochures and flyers from club-sponsored events, and other events and concerts that members attended are also included.

Articles and notebooks about bands and events by David Benner, a founding member of the ICBC, and class assignments from his time at SSU are also included.  In addition to articles written by Benner, there are a number of newspaper articles about Blues performers and ICBC events in the collection.  

Of special interest are photographs of performances, photos and information on Blues bands such as "The Impalas" and "Howard and the White Boys", and a demo tape and video performance of Roy Gaines and the "Blues Man for Life Band."
