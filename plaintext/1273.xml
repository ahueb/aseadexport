    Scope and Contents
This record series includes original issues of the Springfield Record newspaper  between August 15 and August 20, 1908 during the Springfield Race Riots.  While the newspaper contains articles on a variety of subjects, ranging from sports to local and national new, the primary significance of these issues are the articles that pertain to the Race Riots.  These articles include stories about mob lynchings, mob prosecutions, stories pertaining to survivors, and the trial that instigated the riot.  The newspapers are damaged significantly from acidity and weathering and are very brittle as a result.  Some also look to have been eaten away by mice and/ or insects.
