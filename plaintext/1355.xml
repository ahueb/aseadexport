Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Everson discusses her experience at Sangamon State University as a professor of English for over 30 years and as an administrator serving on committees to create the university infrastructure in the early years.  She came to SSU when it first started because it allowed her and her husband to teach at the same university; other university staff and colleagues included former President Naomi Lynn and Vice-president Wayne Penn.
