    Scope and Contents
Prior to 1980 every graduating student at UIS was required to submit a Graduation Report to his advisor 30 days before the end the student's final term.  This applied to undergraduate and graduate students.  The reports consisted of a self assessment and demonstration of the student's academic achievement and communication skills.  Teacher evaluations are also included in some reports.
