    Scope and Contents
"The Community College Frontiers" office records consist of correspondence , complimentary letters to newly appointed college officials, minutes of editorial board meetings, financial records, reports, annual and monthly  reports made by the business office.  Also included is material on the conventions of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges, 1977,1978 &amp; 1980.
    Community College Frontiers was a quarterly journal, jointly sponsored by Governors State and Sangamon State Universities, which published the first issue in 1972 (winter) and ceased publication in 1982 because of financial problems.  The purpose of the journal was to provide a means of communication among two-year colleges and between community colleges and senior institutions; to foster closer cooperation and better articulation of programs among two-year colleges and senior instructions; and to encourage the organization of research on problems of mutual concern along with the dissemination of research results. The editor of the journal was J. Richard Johnston, while G. Ernst Giesecke and Albert Martin were the editorial advisors.
