    Scope and Contents
The "Coal Mining in Illinois Project subject file consists of originals and photocopies dating from 1909 to 1970's of by-laws, minutes and resolutions of the Illinois Women's Auxiliary of the Progressive Mine Workers of America; newspaper clippings concerning  the PMA; the struggle between the Progressive Mine Workers and the United Mine Workers, and copies of the "Progressive Miner";  documents, letters and correspondence of the Oral History Association; plus the correspondence and grant proposals of  the Oral History Office at SSU.  
The file also contains several tributes to persons involved in Illinois coal mining accounts of the controversial events at DuQuoin, Cherry, Mulkeytown, and Wilsonville, Illinois in the early 1900s; and several photocopied articles by John H. Keiser.  
Also included are foundation lists, reports and addresses of Sen. Paul Douglas, assorted mine worker memorabilia, and a  Springfield, Illinois chronology.  
The material was collected by Barbara (Bobbe) Herndon in 1973-77 as part of a research grant project that was not funded.
