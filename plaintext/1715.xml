Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Moore, a former Illinois State Police trooper and Equal Opportunity Officer discusses his educational experience at Sangamon State University.  He received an undergraduate degree in criminal justice and graduated with a master's in public administration in 1985.  Moore describes the "cornfield divide" that existed between the university and the community and how the community involvement of some of the early faculty helped bridge that divide.
