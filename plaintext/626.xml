Arnold, a "Marine Against the War," discusses the development of his political and social beliefs and his decision to enlist in the Marines to learn the truth about the Vietnamese Conflict and organize anti-war sentiment from within the military.

He retells his tour of duty and reflects on life after military service, his work for the War Resisters League and Vietnam Vets Against the War, the treatment of veterans, destroying his military medals in protest, and the lasting effects of the war on veterans. 8 tapes, 720 min., 136 pp.
