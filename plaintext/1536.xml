    Scope and Contents
Philosophy and Human Values Sequence Records,  (1976-) consists of course descriptions, syllabi, bibliographies, and guidelines for adding and dropping courses.  The Philosophy and Human Values Sequence does not offer a degree; it is a course sequence that can be taken in addition to or incorporated into a student's program.  In 1989 the sequence name changed to Philosophy and in 1993 the sequence was changed to become a minor.  This minor in Philosophy is to increase awareness of personal values and the major value conflicts in contemporary society, and to development understanding of the nature and limits of various forms knowledge.
