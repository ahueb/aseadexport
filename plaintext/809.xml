    Scope and Contents
Founded in 1982 as the Springfield Peace Coalition by Ed Haber, Phil Salisbury, Alice Kaige, Jarl Tremail, Tom Kinzie, and John Williams.  Aligned with the Illinois Nuclear Weapons FREEZE, its purpose was to educate the public about the threat of nuclear war and to secure public support for actions which would reduce the chance of nuclear confrontation between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. In 1985, the Coalition affiliated with the national Mobilization for Survival and changed its name to Springfield Mobilization for Peace and Justice. 
Correspondence, minutes, agendas, organizational resolution, petitions, press releases, flyers, an audio cassette, newsletters, news clippings and collected reference materials documenting its lobbying, canvassing, educational and research activities. Petitions reflect the Coalition's effort to express opposition to the Nuclear Arms Race and obtain public support from Springfield citizens by conducting a massive petition drive in Sangamon County.
