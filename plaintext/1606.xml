    Scope and Contents
Applied Study is administratively and academically connected with all degree programs at Sangamon State.  Before 1992 an Applied Study Term was a requirement for the bachelor's degree in all programs.  It is still a requirement in some programs, and is optional in all.  This series consists of correspondence, memos, committee minutes,  reports, brochures and pamphlets.  Several papers written by Applied Study administrators and faculty members are included.
