    Scope and Contents
"Eyewitness Illinois; Memoirs of  the Governors"  was planned and executed in two stages.  
The first was recording,  transcribing and editing interviews with former governors and other former public officials.  
The second was disseminating this oral history by writing and dispatching  press releases.  
The Illinois Humanities Council funded the project in its first stage; the MacArthur Foundation provided money for the second.  
Project Summary (Box 2, last folder)  is a succinct account and critical appraisal of the project.
Box 3 contains the card index of data collected on Illinois' governors.
