ADLAI E. STEVENSON PROJECT 
Ambassador Blair, assistant to Adlai Stevenson from 1950-60, recalls his work with Stevenson on the Com-mittee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, his conversion to and support of the Democratic Party, and working on Stevenson's 1948 campaign for governor. He discusses Stevenson's private and public character, problems and successes of his term as governor of Illinois, the 1952 and 1956 presidential campaigns, his prospects for running in 1960, and his appointment as United Nations Ambassador. Blair also discusses Stevenson's relationships with John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Dwight Eisenhower, Estes Kefauver, Richard Daley, Jack Arvey, and Harry Truman. 94 pp., plus index
