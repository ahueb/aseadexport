    Scope and Contents
The SSU Weekly is a newsletter first published at the beginning of the 1984 Fall term.  It includes information about people, events, awards, promotions and schedule of meetings held on campus.  It is published weekly during the spring and fall semesters, once over winter break and bi-weekly during the summer  term.
The SSU Weekly became the UIS Weekly with the Volume 11, No. 26 July 17, 1995 edition following the merger of Sangamon State University with the University of Illinois.
The SSU Weekly morphed into The Weekly in September, 2001.  The Weekly became the BiWeekly for a short time beginning January, 2002.  After June 24, 2002, the UIS BiWeekly became an online only version titled "Campus News" but known as the eBiweekly.
