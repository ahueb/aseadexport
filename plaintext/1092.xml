    Scope and Contents
Francis Halligan, successful businessman, pianist, and inventor in the Beardstown, Illinois, area, discusses many aspects of early 20th century life and his pioneering work in aviation. He recalls his invention, the "Halligan plane", an aircraft capable of vertical flight: construction and test flight of the prototype aircraft, aircraft technology, dirigibles, and his experiences at the Third National Aeronautic meeting. He also discusses his family's grocery store and dry goods business, and entertainment: river showboats in Beardstown, carnivals, hot air balloons, theaters and movies, steamboats and railroads, and his musical training and teaching career. References are made to the 1922 Beardstown flood, early aircraft, and famous aviators including Orville 
Wright. 2 tapes, 162 mins., 61 pp.
