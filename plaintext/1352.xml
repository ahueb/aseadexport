Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
J. Farrington discusses his experiences attending classes in accountancy at Sangamon State University, graduating in 1990.  He worked at Pillsbury Mills, a local manufacturing plant that helped to pay his tuition.  He remembers the helpful professors that enabled the completion of his degree by taking 48 hours in one year because the plant was closing.  Doug said that SSU "really opened my mind to things outside of my current realm of understanding of the world at that time."
