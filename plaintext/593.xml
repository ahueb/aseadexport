    Scope and Contents
The Donner Family Collection consists of newspaper articles, artifacts, books, correspondence, photographs, articles, journals, newsletters, brochures, notes, photocopies, posters, land grants and deeds, videocassettes, cassette tapes and CD-ROMs. The material pertains to the family of George Donner, who left Sangamon County, Illinois in 1846 to emigrate to California. After a series of mishaps and delays, they and their emigrant party were trapped by heavy snow and faced starvation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the winter of 1846-47. The collection also documents the Oregon Trail and western migration in general. 

The material was collected by William Springer and his brother Don, direct descendants of George Donner. 

Series 1, the Donner Party (Boxes 1-2, and 3, folders 1-17), concentrates on the history of the Donner Party as well as newspaper articles on the Donner Family. There is a large section on Donner Family genealogy, specifically focusing on the Donner Family Reunion in 1996. The series also has photographs of the Donner Museum and various Donner memorials, taken by Don and William Springer.

Series 2, Donner Culture (Box 3, folders 18-19 and box 4, folders 1-9), concentrates on the Donner Party as represented in various media. It contains notes, newspaper articles, correspondence, pamphlets, and audio and videotapes of songs, plays, movies, documentaries, and an opera relating to the Donner Party. 

Series 3, Oregon Trail, 1842-1860 (Box 4, folders 10-17, and boxes 5-7), concentrates on the history of the Oregon Trail and westward expansion. Much of the material relates to the Oregon-California Trail Association (OCTA), its journal, membership information and newsletters, and photocopies of books on the Oregon Trail. Also contains photographs from trips by the Springer brothers along the Oregon Trail. 

Series 4 contains books shelved in Special Collections. These are mostly books on the Donner Party, including histories, children's literature, fiction, a graphic novel, and poetry. Also contains books on the history of the Oregon Trail. Some of the books have notes and annotations by the Springer brothers.
September, 2009 - additional books for Special Collection.

Series 5 consists of artifacts, posters and documents donated by the Springer family that are related to the Donner family: original land patents dating from 1835 and 1841, commemorative plate, covered wagon replica, a large reprint of  a western region map dating from 1846, and various framed posters. Part of the collection is located in the Oversize cabinet.

The collection is arranged topically. The earliest original material dates from 1835 and photocopied and reprinted material dates back to 1840.
