Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Hurwitz discusses his experience in the creation of Sangamon State University.  He along with other business people and legislators (former Governors Otto Kerner and Richard Ogilvie, former Mayor Nelson Howarth, land owner Adolf Lubin, and Board of Education member George Cohen) were instrumental in establishing the university after the law allowed it in the late 1960s.  At that time, industry was reluctant to locate in the city because of the lack of higher education.
