Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Davis, Emeritus Professor of History at SSU/UIS and retired after 39 years of teaching and participation in the experiment that was Sangamon State University.  He started at SSU when the university first began by hiring the faculty, some of whom he described as "de-frocked priests" and "refugees from the campus battles of the 1960s."  Davis started the Oral History Office at SSU as a means to preserve less prominent historical interests such as women, minorities, and the poor.  Those oral histories remain as part of the Special Collections at the UIS Archives in Brookens Library.
