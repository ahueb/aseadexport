<p>Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Robert M. Wesley, the current Executive Director for Regional Medical Programs at the SIU School of Medicine, discusses his early life and experiences at SSU from 1970-1975. Wesley received his bachelor's from the University in 1973, his master's in 1975 and also worked for a time in the Center for the Study of Middle Sized Cities. Wesley, himself a Vietnam veteran, recalls that SSU was very open to veterans and other not-traditional students. He especially remembers professors Robert Thorsen, Ted Cloak, Jerry Colliver, Conald Faust, Collum Davis, Regan Smith, Dave and Judy Everson, Jackie Jackson, Proshanta Nandi and Chuck Strozier. Wesley remembers the University's commitment to public service and community involvement and cites his exposure to these principles as important in his life today. The interviewer is Cullom Davis, professor emeritus of history at SSU/UIS.
