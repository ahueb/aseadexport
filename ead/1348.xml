<p>Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Barbara Ferrara, in 2010 the Associate Director of the Center for State Policy and Leadership at UIS, reminisces about her career at the University.  A 35 year employee of SSU/UIS, Ferrara discusses her experiences as a researcher and project manager within the University's public affairs division. She recalls a number of projects in which the University conducted research and program evaluation on behalf of Illinois state agencies and her role in these assignments. Ferrara also relates her involvement in campus projects, such as the creation of a series of policy summits and work with the engaged citizenship speakers program. Ferrara documents UIS' efforts to create the Illinois Channel, a public affairs TV station modeled on C-SPAN for the state of Illinois. She remembers working with a number of SSU/UIS faculty and staff including Naomi Lynn, John Collins, Richard Schuldt, Barbara Blankenship, Nancy Ford, Mike Lennon, Cullom Davis, Margie Williams, Charlie Wheeler, Carol Bloemer, and Phllip Paludan.  Barbara concludes with her recollections of leading the formation of The Academic Professional Advisory Committee in 1995 at the time of the merger with the University of Illinois; and serving as its first chair from 1996-1999.
