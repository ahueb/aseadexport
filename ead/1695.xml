<p>Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Henderson, retired architect, discusses his experiences growing up in Vincennes, Indiana, St. Louis, Missouri, and Springfield, Illinois.  In early tapes he focuses on his hobbies of aviation and sketching, his education at the University of Illinois, and his experiences in the United States military.  In later tapes he speaks about the architectural offices he worked for and the projects he played a major role in, specifically the Old State Capitol and the Lincoln Home area in downtown Springfield, as well as buildings at the University of Illinois at Springfield.  Additionally, he reminisces about his family (wife Brynn) noting specifically his children:  Rebecca, Katherine, Kirsten, Earl, and Timothy.
