John Takeuchi, Sangamon State University's first architect, reminisces about overseeing the physical development of the University from 1970-1976. Takeuchi remembers individuals including SSU President Robert C. Spencer, Dean Collins (engineer), Wally Henderson (Architect), and Dick Williams. Takeuchi discusses his prior professional experience at the University of California Berkley, where he worked as an architect for twenty-two years. Takeuchi also relates his involvement in the architectural planning of the University of Louisville and Virginia Commonwealth University, after his departure from SSU. Takeuchi, along with his companion Gloria Morita since 2001, speak in detail about their experiences as Japanese-Americans during World War II, including racist government policy and their forced evacuation to internment camps. The interviewer is Cheryl Peck, former Director of Public Relations for SSU/UIS.
