<p>Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Henderson, architect for the University's Public Affairs Center (PAC) building, discusses his early life, education and career. Born in Springfield, Henderson attended the University of Illinois and earned a degree in architectural engineering in 1954. After a period of service in the armed forces, Henderson worked for William Muchow's architectural firm in Denver, Colorado. Following this, he returned to Springfield and opened his own architectural office, Ferry and Henderson, with his partner Donald Ferris. Henderson describes feeling strongly about the need for higher education in Springfield and cites his early support to establish a university in the state capitol. Henderson discusses the challenges and the successes that were involved in constructing the PAC building and is particularly proud of the Sangamon Auditorium. He recalls charter President Robert Spencer and John Kennedy, director of the auditorium. The interviewer is Janice Spears, former school administrator and UIS alumnus.
