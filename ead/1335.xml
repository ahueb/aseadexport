<p>Alumni SAGE Society Legacy Oral History Project
Bradley received a degree in political studies from Sangamon State in 1972, was the first student elected as university assembly speaker, and was then hired as SSU alumni director.  He discusses early experiences on campus when the physical campus was not completed and classes were held in the First Methodist church.  He reminisces about the first President Bob Spencer and his advisor David Everson, as well as early activities at SSU such as the China Intersession and a visit to SSU by Jimmy Carter before being elected president.
